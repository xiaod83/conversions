## Welcome to Jekyll!

This is an example post to show you how easy it is to write articles.

### How to Create a New Post

1. Create a file in `_posts/` folder
2. Name it like: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` (e.g., `2025-10-29-my-article.md`)
3. Add front matter at the top (the stuff between the `---`)
4. Write your content in Markdown below

### Markdown Basics

You can use:

- **Bold text** with `**bold**`
- *Italic text* with `*italic*`
- `Code snippets` with backticks
- Links like [this](https://conversions.studio)

```python
# Code blocks with syntax highlighting
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

### Math Support (if needed)

You can even add equations:

$$E = mc^2$$

### That's It!

Just commit and push to GitHub. Your article appears automatically.
